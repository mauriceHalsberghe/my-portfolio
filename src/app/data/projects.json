      "This project was made for Boudewijn Seapark. It keeps track of what employees do certain tasks, where and when. It was a group project in teams of 3, and it took us about 2 and a half months and more than 20.000 lines of code to complete.",
      "We made a login and register page for the employees where they can create their account and login with a pincode. They can complete general, daily, weekly and monthly tasks, and see a progressbar for each department.",
      "There are daily water analyses to measure for example the temperature and acidity of each pool. If a certain measurement does not meet the quota of the maximum or minimum value, everyone will receive a notification about that measurement.",
      "The admin has the authority to see, create, update and delete tasks, users and measurement definitions. There is also an option to export all the task data to Excel."

      "For the overall styling, I was inspired by the nostalgic charm and Frutiger Aero aesthetic of Windows 7, using glassy surfaces, radiant hues, and a futuristic feel. Taking a trip down memory lane.",
